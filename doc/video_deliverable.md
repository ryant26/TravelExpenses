# Video Deliverable
I recorded the video 10 â€“ 15 times to try and get it under the 2min mark. The emulator was simply too slow (specifically when choosing dates) and there was too many dialogs to traverse when adding claims / expenses in my app, to complete the list in under 2 min. On a physical device it might be possible.
